            <h2>What I've Gained from Gaming</h2>
                <p>🔵 <strong>Balance Work and Rest</strong>: Taking a break is essential to continue with research. 🛌 Rest is key to going the distance!</p>
                <p>🌟 <strong>Focus!</strong> Maintaining concentration is crucial for success. 🤓 Stay focused and hit the target!</p>
                <p>📚 <strong>Avoid Being a Slacker, Set Clear Goals</strong>: Establish clear objectives and don't just go with the flow. 🏆 Having goals gives you direction!</p>
                <p>💡 <strong>Act on Your Ideas</strong>: Once you have an idea, act on it immediately without hesitation. Good topics are limited; if you can think of it, so can others. ⏩ Seize the inspiration and act fast!</p>

            <h2>Who Should Play</h2>
            <p>For those considering a PhD, playing the game multiple times can provide insights into the challenges involved. Current PhD students without a clear direction may find valuable guidance on how to graduate on time. Professors looking to give their students a realistic glimpse into the PhD journey should consider incorporating the game into their curriculum.</p>
