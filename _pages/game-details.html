            <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p>The PhD Simulator is a unique game crafted by a PhD graduate from the University of Washington, currently employed at Google. This game was developed to celebrate the author's successful graduation and mirrors the many challenges of a PhD journey within its gameplay.</p>

           <h2>Gameplay</h2>
           <p>The game is straightforward, featuring scenarios and choices that reflect the academic experience. As you make decisions, the 'Hope' meter at the top left corner of the screen changes.</p>

            <h2>My Experience: What I've Gained from Gaming</h2>
            <p>I found the game to be a realistic reflection of the PhD journey. It taught me the importance of balancing work and rest, maintaining focus, setting clear goals, and acting on ideas promptly.</p>
                <p>🔵 <strong>Work-Life Balance:</strong> Embracing breaks is crucial for ongoing research productivity. 🛌 Relaxation is key to a balanced and productive lifestyle!</p>
                <p>🌟 <strong>Sharp Focus:</strong> Maintaining concentration is crucial for success. 🤓 Stay focused and hit the target!</p>
                <p>📚 <strong>Goal-Oriented Mindset:</strong> Set definitive goals to avoid aimlessness. 🏆 Well-defined objectives provide a clear path forward! </p>
                <p>💡 <strong>Ideas into Action:</strong> Pounce on your ideas without delay; hesitation can lead to missed opportunities. Good research topics are scarce, and if you think of one, chances are others might too. ⏩ Turn inspiration into immediate action!</p>

            <h2>Who Should Play</h2>
            <p><strong>For those considering a PhD</strong>, playing the game multiple times can provide insights into the challenges involved. <strong>Current PhD students</strong> without a clear direction may find valuable guidance on how to graduate on time. <strong>Professors</strong> looking to give their students a realistic glimpse into the PhD journey should consider incorporating the game into their curriculum.</p> <!-- Corrected the strong tags -->
