            <h3>About the Game:</h3>
            <p>The PhD Simulator is a unique game crafted by a PhD graduate from the University of Washington, currently employed at Google. This game was developed to celebrate the author's successful graduation and mirrors the many challenges of a PhD journey within its gameplay.</p>

            <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
            <p>The game is straightforward, featuring scenarios and choices that reflect the academic experience. As you make decisions, the 'Hope' meter at the top left corner of the screen changes.</p>

            <h3>My Experience:</h3>
            <p>I found the game to be a realistic reflection of the PhD journey. It taught me the importance of balancing work and rest, maintaining focus, setting clear goals, and acting on ideas promptly.</p>

            <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Balance work and rest: Taking breaks is essential for sustained research productivity.</li>
                <li>Focus: Stay concentrated on your goals.</li>
                <li>Clarity: Be clear about your objectives and don't be a passive participant.</li>
                <li>Initiative: Act on your ideas without hesitation; if you think of a good research topic, others might too.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For those considering a PhD, I recommend playing the game multiple times to understand the challenges involved. For
