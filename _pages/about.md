Research Interest

## **The Evolution of My Research Interests**
Reflecting on my previous academic journey, it may seem broad in scope, but I see it as a natural evolution of my interests within the field of public policy and administration. My passion for exploration has been the compass guiding my studies, and the experiences Iâ€™ve gathered have greatly enriched my understanding and perspectives. Therefore, I would like to offer a more detailed account of how my research interests have evolved, in the hope that this will help you know me better.

**During my undergraduate studies**, my focus was on <u>local government responsiveness, transparency, and message strategy</u>. My role as a <u>research assistant</u> allowed me to delve into the realms of <u>collaborative governance and public service provision</u>. It was also during this time that my passion for <u>environmental and sustainability policies</u>, particularly in the area of <u>river and water governance</u>, was ignited through my participation in extracurricular activities and volunteer work. Furthermore, my undergraduate experience was enriched by social practice research, which cultivated a strong interest in services designed for the elderly. This research underscored the importance of tailoring public policies to meet the unique needs of this demographic. Through these diverse experiences, I learned the importance of aligning public policy with the specific needs of different community segments, a lesson that has been central to my academic and professional growth.

**In graduate school**, my attention turned to <u>government transparency (both administrative and fiscal transparency), performance management, digital governance, AI policy, and environmental policies (climate change and energy just transition)</u>. My research and exploration of AI, especially generative AI, revealed its potential to streamline public sector operations and improve policy effectiveness. However, I also became aware of the double-edged nature of technology, understanding its potential to disrupt, for instance, higher education and its challenges for public administration. This realization has led me to understand the critical necessity of integrating critical thinking and ethical considerations into our policies and practices in our rapidly evolving era.
