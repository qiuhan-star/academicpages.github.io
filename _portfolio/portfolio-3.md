## **Career Goals and Planning**
My career vision is to become an influential female scholar and teacher in the field of public affairs, with a dedication to shaping the discipline’s discourse, advancing practical applications, and nurturing a new generation of public policy experts and leaders. This aspiration is deeply rooted in my personal academic journey and the profound influence of the professors who have inspired and empowered me along the way.

Throughout my academic journey, I have had the good fortune of being guided by several exceptional mentors. They have not only imparted their knowledge but have also exemplified the transformative power of education through their actions and words. They taught me that every individual, regardless of background or faced prejudices, has the potential to drive meaningful change. These encounters have fueled a profound wish in me to convey the same empowering messages and resilience to my peers, those around me, and, in the future, to my students.

During my Ph.D. studies, I aim to refine my academic expertise and teaching abilities in pursuit of a tenure-track position. This goal is fueled by my desire to contribute to the academic discourse in the United States through my research and teaching endeavors. In ten years, I envision myself as a leading scholar, who catalyzes change within the academic and policy realms. I aim to translate my research into actionable insights that can inform and improve policy decisions, thereby making a tangible impact on the field.

To realize this vision, I am dedicated to establishing a network of collaborative relationships with scholars worldwide. This network will contribute to the advancement of research and foster a rich, international exchange of ideas. I am eager to participate in the peer review process as an editor for academic journals in the future, which will enable me to directly influence the quality and direction of research in my field. Moreover, I aspire to offer strategic advice to government and non-governmental organizations, utilizing my expertise to guide and shape policy decisions. My commitment to excellence in teaching, mentoring policymakers, and advancing U.S.-China academic exchanges remains steadfast, with the goal of enabling more students to gain access to top-tier higher education opportunities.

Beyond being a teacher, I aspire to be a catalyst for my students’ personal and professional development. I plan to create a learning environment that is both demanding and nurturing, encouraging students to think critically, engage with complex issues, and devise solutions to real-world challenges. By doing so, I hope to instill in them a sense of agency and the confidence to effect change in their respective fields, just as my mentors did for me.
