title: "Research Interests"
excerpt: "Reflecting on my previous academic journey, it may seem broad in scope, but I see it as a natural evolution of my interests within the field of public policy and administration. My passion for exploration has been the compass guiding my studies, and the experiences I’ve gathered have greatly enriched my understanding and perspectives. Therefore, I would like to offer a more detailed account of how my research interests have evolved, in the hope that this will help you know me better." #<br/> <img src='/images/500x300.png'>
