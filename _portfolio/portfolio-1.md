title: "Research Interests"
excerpt: "Reflecting on my previous academic journey, it may seem broad in scope, but I see it as a natural evolution of my interests within the field of public policy and administration. My passion for exploration has been the compass guiding my studies, and the experiences Iâ€™ve gathered have greatly enriched my understanding and perspectives. Therefore, I would like to offer a more detailed account of how my research interests have evolved, in the hope that this will help you know me better." #<br/> <img src='/images/500x300.png'>
